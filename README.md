WooCommerce Force Default Variant

This is currently a work in progress for a WooCommerce Plugin to force a default Variant.
As a standard, if no default variant is set, WooCommerce will fall back to 'Choose an Option'. This plugin removes this option and instead defaults to a chosen order. Currently the Variants can be ordered by ID and Price (low to high, and high to low).#
This also removes the 'Clear Selection' link.
